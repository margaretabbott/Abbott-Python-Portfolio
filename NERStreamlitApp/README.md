# Name Entity Ruler Streamlit App 
## Project Overview 
### The goal of this project is to display my knowledge of Streamlit and natural langague processing by creating an app that allows users to explore Named Entity Recognition (NER) by inputting or uploading text and defining custom entity labels and patterns. Using spaCyâ€™s EntityRuler, the app applies these custom rules to extract and visualize entities directly in the submitted text. 
## Instructions 
### This Python file is dependent on three Python libraries beyound the basic language: Pandas, Streamlit, and Spacy, all three of these libraries must be properly imported for this code to run properly.
