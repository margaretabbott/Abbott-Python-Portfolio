# Margaret Abbott's Python Portfolio
### This repository is designed to display my python and technical skills. It is regularly updated with my most recent works. 
## Basic Streamlit App 
### Description 
#### Streamlit is designed to create interactive web applications with minimal python code. To use streamlit, the user must make sure they initialize the app using streamlit run... in the visual studio terminal.
#### This project expands my skillset to use simple Python code to create interactive web applications. It is beneficial as I do not have knowledge of JavaScript or other programs that could be used to create web applications.
#### Skills: Python, Streamlit, Pandas

## TidyData Project
### Description 
#### The goal of this project is to apply the principles of tidy data using Python by cleaning, structuring, and visualizing a real-world dataset in a Jupyter Notebook. Following Hadley Wickham's framework, the project ensures that each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table, making data analysis more efficient.
#### This project expands my skillset to allow me to clean and transform data into the most useful version. Using tidy data techniques, I can better analyze data and create more effective visualizations.
#### Skills: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, MatPlotLib
