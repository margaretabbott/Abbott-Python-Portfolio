# Margaret Abbott's Python Portfolio
#### This repository is designed to display my python and technical skills. It is regularly updated with my most recent works. 
## Basic Streamlit App 
### Description:
Streamlit is designed to create interactive web applications with minimal python code. To use streamlit, the user must make sure they initialize the app using streamlit run... in the visual studio terminal.

This project expands my skillset to **use simple Python code to create interactive web applications**. It is beneficial as I do not have knowledge of JavaScript or other programs that could be used to create web applications.
#### Skills: Python, Streamlit, Pandas

## TidyData Project
### Description:
The goal of this project is to apply the principles of tidy data using Python by cleaning, structuring, and visualizing a real-world dataset in a Jupyter Notebook. Following Hadley Wickham's framework, the project ensures that each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table, making data analysis more efficient.

This project expands my skillset to allow me to **clean and transform data into the most useful version**. Using tidy data techniques, I can better analyze data and create more effective visualizations.
#### Skills: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, MatPlotLib

## Data Analysis With Python 
### Description:
This folder holds the work I completed in an course titled "Data Analysis with Python" in Spring 2025. These assignments display knowledge of **performing data-intensive tasks to make raw data organized, readable, and clean**. 
#### Skills: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, MatPlotLib, NumPy, yFinanace, mplFinance, Prophet, sklLearn, DateTime

## Name Entity Ruler Streamlit App 
### Description:
The goal of this project is to display my knowledge of Streamlit and natural langague processing by creating an app that allows users to **explore Named Entity Recognition (NER)** by inputting or uploading text and defining custom entity labels and patterns. Using **spaCy’s EntityRuler**, the app applies these custom rules to extract and visualize entities directly in the submitted text.

This project expands my skillset to **upload a Streamlit app into the cloud community**. 
#### Skills: Python, Streamlit, SpaCy, Pandas

## Streamlit App Final
### Description 
The goal of this project is to demonstrate my **proficiency in Streamlit, data parsing, and data visualization** by creating an app that allows users to **analyze rowing workout data exported from NK CoxBox or SpeedCoach** devices. The app automatically detects and processes multiple data sections within a CSV file, cleans and structures the data, and enables interactive selection of key performance metrics. It generates insightful visualizations—including stroke rate trends, split times, and efficiency comparisons - to assist coaches, coxswains, and rowers in evaluating on-the-water performance.

This project expands my skillset as I have never used **StringIO** before.
