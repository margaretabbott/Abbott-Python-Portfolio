# Basic Streamlit App
### Project Overview:
This project was my **first experience using Streamlit**. I built a **simple interactive web app** that loads a dataset of penguins, displays it, and allows users to filter the data by selecting an island. This project helped me learn the basics of creating web apps with Streamlit, working with dataframes, and building interactive widgets like dropdown menus.
