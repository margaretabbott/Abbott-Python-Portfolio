# Streamlit App Final Project 
### Project Overview: 
The goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in Streamlit, data parsing, and data visualization by developing an advanced app that enables detailed analysis of rowing workout data exported from NK CoxBox or SpeedCoach devices. The app automatically identifies and extracts multiple structured data sections embedded within CSV files, even when those sections contain inconsistent formatting or varying header rows. It cleans and structures the data, dynamically recognizes relevant performance metrics (such as stroke rate, distance, split time, and heart rate), and provides interactive controls for users to customize their analysis. Leveraging pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization, the app produces insightful, real-time charts that track stroke rate trends, split times, and efficiency comparisons like meters-per-stroke. Designed specifically for coaches, coxswains, and rowers, the app streamlines performance review by transforming raw workout data into clear, actionable insights. This project also reflects my ability to handle complex data preprocessing, implement robust error handling, and create a user-friendly interface for a specialized audience.
