# Tidy Data Project 
## Project Overview 
### The goal of this project is to apply the principles of *tidy data* using Python by cleaning, structuring, and visualizing a real-world dataset in a Jupyter Notebook. Following Hadley Wickham's framework, the project ensures that each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table, making data analysis more efficient.
## Instructions 
### This Juypter notebook is dependent on three Python libraries beyound the basic language: Pandas, Seaborn, and MatPlotLib, all three of these libraries must be properly imported for this Notebook to run properly.
